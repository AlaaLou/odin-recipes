        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <em>Serve these crispy noodles with Chinese mustard and duck sauce as an appetizer, or use them as a garnish for soups. They're just like the ones you get at a Chinese restaurant.
         I love to sprinkle them over my egg-drop soup.</em>

            <li>1 (10 ounce) package egg roll wrappers</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
